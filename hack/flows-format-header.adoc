= Network Flows format reference

This is the specification of the network flows format, used both internally and when exporting flows to Kafka.

The document is organized in two main categories: _Labels_ and regular _Fields_. This distinction only matters when querying Loki. This is because _Labels_, unlike _Fields_, must be used in link:https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/log_queries/#log-stream-selector[stream selectors].

If you are reading this specification as a reference for the Kafka export feature, you must treat all _Labels_ and _Fields_ as regular fields and ignore any distinctions between them that are specific to Loki.
