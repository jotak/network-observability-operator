= Network Flows format specifications

This is the specification of the network flows format, used both internally and when exporting flows to Kafka.

The document is organized in two main categories: _Labels_ and regular _Fields_. This distinction only matters when querying Loki. This is because _Labels_, unlike _Fields_, must be used in link:https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/log_queries/#log-stream-selector[stream selectors].

When using this specification as a reference for exporting flows to Kafka, you must ignore this distinction about _Labels_ and _Fields_, and consider all of them at the same level in the JSON structure.
