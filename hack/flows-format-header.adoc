= Network Flows format specifications

Description::
+
This is the specification of the network flows format, used both internally and in exporter feature such as Kafka export.
+
The document is organized in two main categories: _Labels_ and regular _Fields_. This distinction only matters when querying Loki, as _Labels_, unlike _Fields_, must be used in link:https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/log_queries/#log-stream-selector[stream selectors].
+
Outside of Loki context, for instance when reading this specification as a documentation for the Kafka export feature, you must ignore this distinction about _Labels_ and _Fields_, and consider all of them at the same level in the JSON structure.
