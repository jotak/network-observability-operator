= Network Flows format reference

This is the specification of the network flows format. That format is used when a Kafka exporter is configured, for Prometheus metrics labels as well as internally for the Loki store.

The "Filter ID" column shows which related name to use when defining Quick Filters (see `spec.consolePlugin.quickFilters` in the `FlowCollector` specification).

The "Loki label" column is useful when querying Loki directly: label fields need to be selected using link:https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/log_queries/#log-stream-selector[stream selectors].

The "Cardinality" column gives information about the implied metric cardinality if this field was to be used as a Prometheus label with the `FlowMetrics` API. Refer to the `FlowMetrics` documentation for more information on using this API.
